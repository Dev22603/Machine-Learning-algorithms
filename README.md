# Machine Learning Algorithms Repository

Welcome to the Machine Learning Algorithms Repository! This repository contains implementations of various machine learning algorithms using Python. Whether you're new to machine learning or looking to refresh your knowledge of fundamental algorithms, you've come to the right place.

Each algorithm is implemented as a standalone Python script, making it easy to understand and integrate into your own projects. The goal of this repository is to provide clear and concise implementations of popular machine learning algorithms, along with explanations of how they work.

## Algorithms Included

Currently, this repository includes implementations of the following machine learning algorithms:

1. Linear Regression
2. Logistic Regression
3. k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
4. Decision Trees
5. Random Forests
6. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
7. K-Means Clustering
8. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
9. Neural Networks (Single-layer Perceptron)

## Usage

Each algorithm is contained within its own directory, which includes the implementation script, a sample dataset (if applicable), and a README.md file providing more information about the algorithm and its usage.

To use any of these algorithms, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the directory of the algorithm you're interested in.
2. Read the README.md file to understand the algorithm's purpose, working principle, and usage.
3. Open the implementation script (usually named `algorithm_name.py`) to see the code and comments explaining the implementation details.
4. If a sample dataset is provided, you can use it to test the algorithm on your own.

Feel free to modify and adapt these algorithms for your specific projects. If you find any issues or have suggestions for improvements, please consider opening an issue or submitting a pull request. This repository is meant to be a collaborative resource for the machine learning community.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to add a new algorithm implementation, improve an existing one, or fix any issues, please follow these steps:

1. Fork this repository to your GitHub account.
2. Create a new branch for your work: `git checkout -b feature/new-algorithm`.
3. Make your changes and additions.
4. Test your changes thoroughly.
5. Commit your changes with descriptive commit messages.
6. Push your changes to your forked repository.
7. Create a pull request to the original repository's `main` branch.
